/*!normalize.scss [v3.0.2]*/
// makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
// @based on normalize.css.
// @by Nicolas Gallagher, co-created with Jonathan Neal.

// Working Principle:
// 1. normalize.css retains many useful default browser styles.
// 2. This means that you donâ€™t have to redeclare styles for all the common typographic elements.
